# Code Generator

This project is build to demonstrate how SCANNER tokenize words and passes it to PARSER to check if given program follows given BNF grammar. Then, it semantics will be checked based on the tree has been generated by parser.
It has 7 main categories:
* Launcher
	* Will start the program by reading given argument by user, which can be a file or commend line input
* Parser
	* After master file finds file that it needs to open, it will need to pass the filename to parser(filename) which later start calling lookaheads from Scanner for tokens and check if it folows grammar sequence. 
* FSA table generator
	* Scanner will have this function to generate FSA table with acceptance and rejection codes set up
* Filter
	* Will filter out all comments before its passed to scanner
* Driver
	* Will receive filtered word and check if its allowed token based on FSA table
* Static Semantic
	* Will check if variables were declared only once and only use declared varaibles during stat statement
* Termination
	* Scanner will be terminated in case it finds unsupported symbol within FSA table
	* Parser will be terminated in case it finds unsupoorted sequence of token found thru Scanner.
	* Static Semantics will be terminated in case it finds any violation regarding varaible usage.

## Getting Started
To run the program in commend line type the following:
* To build the project
	* make
* To run the program to request help text
	* ./statSem -h
* To run the program with file
	* ./statSem -f file_name 
		or
	  ./statSem file_name
